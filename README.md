## Assignment

We've seen how to learn an object and then detect it, so now we're going to use this to automate an action.

* You learn to recognize an object by creating a its cascade file (xml).
* You configure your raspberry pi (Jetson Nano) to read in a camera feed.
* This object can then be observed with the raspberry pi (Jetson Nano), for this you use openCV
* You add an object counter that displays in the upper left corner how many of these objects it observes.
* When this object is observed you make sure that the raspberry pi (Jetson Nano) controls an actuator (led, relay, lcd, ...)
